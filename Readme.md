# Udacity Supervised Machine Learning 
This course is introduction to basic Supervised machine learning, focusing equally on the theory and practical aspects. The course includes introduction to Supervised machine learning, various algorithms, evaluation method and Finding Donors project . This course introduces the scikit learn toolkit required for machine learning . This course helps in understanding The issue of dimensionality of data and the task of exploring data, creating models, evaluating models and predicting values. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models have been described, and using scikit learn, predictive modelling methods are introduction for data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting).
