# Intro to Machine Learning using Python 
This course is introduction to basic machine learning, focusing equally on the theory and practical aspects. The course includes introduction to Supervised machine learning , unsupervised learning and Nueral networks . This course introduces the scikit learn toolkit required for machine learning . This course helps in understanding The issue of dimensionality of data and the task of clustering data, as well as evaluating those clusters. Supervised approaches for creating predictive models have been described, and using scikit learn, predictive modelling methods are introduction for data generalizability (e.g. cross validation, overfitting).
